          TBD: Story /
          Painpoint: Being interrupted while in the zone. Expensive in terms of concentration and productivity!
          Working together is great, except when you need to work on your own.
          Working in an office, coworking space or coffee shop 
          can be difficult 
          when you really need to concentrate.
          Situation (working concentratedly & Getting interrupted, pulled out of your zone & necessary communication for next steps)
          Setting (office, coworking space, coffee shop, conference)
          Solution (That's where Kliks come in, help send clear signals. Opt-in to communication with green, opt-out with orange. Network effect with your team, easy to explain, simple to use)
 
          works in teams, non-verbal communication, create a zone around you, visible across the room, send a clear signal, 
          Magnetic, easily attached, simple change of status, no danger to computers, 
          top of your laptop, desk lamp, cubicle wall frame or anywhere it works for you.
